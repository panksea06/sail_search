sail rite/sail right sewing machine seems to be the standard. 
good website and product support, with textiles as well as instruction material and even sailboat data and sailplans for some boat models
portable unit seems to be standard to use, lots of variations but good to have on boat

Dual use: can also use for uphostlery and other home projects
