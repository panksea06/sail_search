Satelite phone and GPS is needed
Will have a boat mounted GPS of course, and some other boat specific coms (radios and such on mast)
but a handheld device as backup and as dingy/ditch gear is critical

Dual use:
Use existing Garmin GPSMap 66i 
Already using this for backbacking/hunting/bike-trek/backcountry-ski
Good to get more familiarity with a single device and use my subscription effectively here
